# TriAnGIL
TriAnGIL involves building heterogeneous subgraphs to capture the higher-order spatial interplay between multiple cell families by focusing on triadic closures and graph-based metrics. It therefore considers both inter- and intra-family relationships between cells to capture complex co-dependencies that are biologically interpretable.
